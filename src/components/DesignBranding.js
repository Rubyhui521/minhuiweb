        <div><p>This logo is designed for a factory called Monva Foundry and Manufacturing, it is in a modern and simple style.</p></div>
        <div><p>I used serif font in this logo to add some romatic. The letter P was made to have a similar look of lolipop to indicate it is a bakery store.</p></div>
        <div><p>This is a redisigned logo. I changed the color of the sapling from yellow to green as green stands for hope. I also added a purple logo - purple is childrenâ€™s favorite color.</p></div>
